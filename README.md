# Code Challenge

Hi there! 🎉

In this challenge we need to build a simple Sinatra app with basic HTML form, this form send POST request to server with amount of money people want to withdraw and in the answer we need to return an array with actual banknotes. The bigger the note, the better 💸💸💸

In our ATM we have endless amount of **$50, $20, $5** notes.


For example:

Jenny wants to witdraw $230, then our ATM return an array like this: 
`[50, 50, 50, 50, 20, 5, 5]`

Please think about edgecases 🙈 💩
